# Project Euler Functions

This is a compilation of some functions that I created to solve some of the problems in the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) archive. 

You can find the R files with my propossed solutions to the first 50 problems of this archive [here](). 

## Using in RStudio

To try this out in RStudio, you just have to do the following:

```
library('devtools')
devtools::install_github('eulerfunctions','emendez0911')
```

## Contribute

This is my first GitHub repo, so I would love to get some feedback on this. Feel free to drop any suggestions you might have to help me improve this and learn even more about R Programming.

I might go back to this in the future, as a keep solving more problems just for the fun of it.
